# What is it?
* Friends and I had been playing a lot of uno in our downtime, and our particular rules caused each game to move too quickly. We began keeping score, and I'm no good at math so I made an app to do the math for me.

# Install instructions
* Clone the repo to your machine by copying the clone link and running `git clone URL` in the terminal.
* Enter the directory you cloned, and in the terminal install the project dependencies with `npm install`.
* You can then use the app by running `http-server` or your choice of other servers in your terminal.

# Future iterations
* Would rather use a framework to build it, but did this for a school project that required vanilla html, css, and js.
* Attach a database so that the scores persist.
